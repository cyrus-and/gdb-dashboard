GDB dashboard
=============

Modular visual interface for GDB in Python.

This comes as a standalone single-file [`.gdbinit`][raw] which, among the other
things, enables a configurable dashboard showing the most relevant information
during the program execution. Its main goal is to reduce the number of GDB
commands issued to inspect the current program status allowing the programmer to
focus on the control flow instead.

Installation
------------

Just place [`.gdbinit`][raw] in your home directory, for example:

    wget -P ~ git.io/.gdbinit

If using this in a docker environment the correct locale must be set. Run this command within the docker container or add as an environmental variable during the container build.

    export LC_CTYPE=C.UTF-8

Features
--------

 * Single GDB init file.

 * Write the dashboard to the main GDB console or to an external file/TTY.

 * Interaction with GDB using the native [Python API][api].

 * Several default modules are included to address the most basic
   needs: source code, assembly, registers, etc.).

 * User-defined modules can be easily developed by extending a
   [Python class](#custom-modules).

 * Additional configuration files (both [GDB][commands] and Python) are read
   from `~/.gdbinit.d/`.

 * Fully stylable user interface and dynamic command prompt.

 * Optional syntax highlighting using the [Pygments][pygments] Python
   library.

 * No GDB command has been redefined, instead all the
   features are available as subcommands of the main `dashboard` command.

Default modules
---------------

Follows the list of bundled default modules. Refer to the GDB help system for
the full syntax.

 * `assembly` shows the disassembled code surrounding the program counter. The
   instructions constituting the current statement are marked, if available.

 * `history` lists the last entries of the GDB value history.

 * `memory` allows to inspect memory regions.

 * `registers` shows the CPU registers and their values.

 * `source` show the program source code, if available.

 * `stack` shows the current stack trace including the function name and the
   file location, if available. Optionally list the frame arguments and locals
   too.

 * `threads` lists the currently available threads.

 * `expressions` watches user expressions.

Dashboard output
----------------

By default the dashboard is displayed in the GDB terminal but the `-output`
command of both the dashboard and modules can change this behavior. When the
output of a module is not specified then the global output is used.

### Display the whole dashboard in another terminal

![Dashboard in another terminal](http://i.imgur.com/6TIKXh0.png)

It may be useful to move the dashboard to another terminal so the main terminal
can be used exclusively for GDB commands and target I/O.

 1. start GDB in one terminal;

 2. open another terminal (e.g. [tmux][tmux] pane) and get its TTY with the
    `tty` command (e.g. `/dev/ttys001`, the name may be different for a variety
    of reasons);

 3. issue the command `dashboard -output /dev/ttys001` to redirect the dashboard
    output to the newly created terminal;

 4. debug as usual.

### Display each module in a separate terminal

![Modules distributed in multiple terminals](http://i.imgur.com/BF7lpzV.png)

It is also possible to display the output of one or more modules to individual
terminals. If two or more modules share the same output, they will be stacked as
usual.

 1. start GDB in one terminal;

 2. open another terminal and get its TTY with the `tty` command;

 3. pick a module, say `source`, then issue the command `dashboard source
    -output /dev/ttys001` to redirect its output to the newly created terminal;

 4. repeat for any other modules;

 5. debug as usual.

### Display the whole dashboard in a web browser

![Dashboard in a web browser](http://i.imgur.com/5uncF7e.png)

Pushing this even further, one could use a web browser as an auxiliary terminal
using [gotty][gotty]. Of course, using the method described above, one can also
display the output of individual modules in one or more web browser instances.

 1. start GDB in one terminal;

 2. open another terminal and execute `gotty sh -c 'tty; cat'`;

 3. open a web browser, navigate to `http://localhost:8080` and note the TTY;

 4. issue the command `dashboard -output /dev/ttys001` to redirect the dashboard
    output to the web browser;

 5. debug as usual.

Commands
--------

The GDB documentation is available at `help dashboard`. Just like any GDB
command, abbreviations are possible, so `da`, `dash`, etc. all resolve to
`dashboard`.

### dashboard

This is the root command and it is used to manually redisplay the dashboard.

### dashboard -configuration [`<file>`]

Display and optionally write to `<file>` the current configuration (layout,
styles, outputs). This command allows to configure the dashboard live then make
the changes permanent, for example:

    dashboard -configuration ~/.gdbinit.d/auto

### dashboard -output [`<file>`]

By default the dashboard is written to the GDB console but it is possible to
redirect its output to a file or even to another terminal. If the target is a
valid terminal TTY then its width is used to format the dashboard, otherwise
fall back to the width of the main GDB console.

Without argument reset this setting to the default.

### dashboard -enabled [on|off]

Enable or disable the automatic display of the dashboard whenever the target
program stops. The dashboard is enabled by default and even when it is disabled,
it can be manually displayed with `dashboard`.

Sometimes it may be convenient to redraw the dashboard even if the target
program has not changed its execution status, for example when the programmer
switches the currently selected frame with the `up` or `down` commands. It is
possible to do so by setting up some GDB hooks in the [user-defined init
file](#configuration), for example:

    define hookpost-up
    dashboard
    end

    define hookpost-down
    dashboard
    end

### dashboard -layout [`<directive>`...]

By default, all the modules are enabled and placed within the dashboard in
alphabetical order. As the number of modules grows, it is important to decide
which modules will be part of the dashboard, and where.

Each directive is in the form `[!]<module>`, when the `!` is present then the
corresponding module is disabled by default. The order of directives denotes the
display order within the dashboard. For example:

    dashboard -layout source !assembly stack

Modules which do not appear in the list are disabled and placed after the last
element in alphabetical order.

When executed without arguments, this command lists all the available modules in
the form of a list of directives followed by the status of the output files of
the modules.

### dashboard -style [`<name>` [`<value>`]]

Access to the stylable attributes of the dashboard, see [Stylable
attributes](#stylable-attributes). For example, to change the prompt to
something more familiar:

    dashboard -style prompt '(gdb)'

The argument is parsed as a Python literal and converted to the proper type.

When only the name is specified this command shows the current value,
whereas without arguments prints all the attributes.

### Modules subcommands

Every module adds its own subcommand `dashboard <module>` which is used to
toggle the enable flag and to redisplay the dashboard.

Modules may also declare additional subcommands, see `help dashboard <module>`
from GDB.

There are two additional predefined subcommands: `-style` and `-output`.

#### -style

If a module declares some stylable attributes then the command `dashboard
<module> -style` will be available. Its functioning is equivalent to
the [`dashboard -style`](#dashboard--style-name-value) command but it does apply
to a module.

#### -output

Similarly, the `dashboard <module> -output` mimics
the [`dashboard -style`](#dashboard--output-file) command but allows a finer
grain of operation.

Configuration
-------------

Files in `~/.gdbinit.d/` are executed in alphabetical order, but the preference
is given to Python files. If there are subdirectories, they are walked
recursively. The idea is to keep separated the custom modules definition from
the configuration itself.

By convention, the *main* configuration file should be placed in `~/.gdbinit.d/`
(say `~/.gdbinit.d/init`) and can be used to tune the dashboard styles and
modules configuration but also the usual GDB parameters.

The alternative is to hard code changes in the provided [`.gdbinit`][raw], to do
so just add new modules and GDB settings under `# Default modules` and `# Better
GDB defaults` respectively.

### Per-project configuration

GDB natively support the auto-loading of `.gdbinit` files, this can come in
handy to set up a different dashboard style according to the current project
type (e.g., C++ development, reverse engineering, etc.). This feature is
disabled by default for security reasons. To enable the auto-loading everywhere
in the file system add this line to the main configuration file:

    set auto-load safe-path /

Stylable attributes
-------------------

There is number of attributes that can be used to customize the aspect of the
dashboard and of its modules. They are documented within the GDB help system.
For what concerns the dashboard itself it can be reached with:

    help dashboard -style

Whereas for modules:

    help dashboard <module> -style

### ANSI escape codes

Colors and text styles are specified using [ANSI][ansi] escape codes. For
example setting a style to `1;31` will produce `^[[1;31m`, which will result in
displaying the text red (`31`) and bright (`1`). The ANSI output can be disabled
by setting the `ansi` attribute to `False` (note that this will not affect the
command prompt).

### Syntax highlighting

When the `ansi` attribute is set to `True` the [Pygments][pygments] Python
library may be used by modules to provide syntax highlighting of the source
code.

The `syntax_highlighting` stylable attribute is a string which defines the
Pygments [style][pygments-styles] to use.

The list of all the available styles can be obtained with (from GDB itself):

```python
python
from pygments.styles import get_all_styles as styles
for s in styles():
    print(s)
end
```

To conveniently cycle through and try each available style (press `Return` to
try the next style and `Ctrl-D` to exit):

```python
python
from pygments.styles import get_all_styles as styles
for s in styles():
    c = 'dashboard -style syntax_highlighting {!r}'.format(s)
    gdb.execute(c)
    print(c)
    input()
end
```

### Dividers

A divider is basically a terminal-wide horizontal line with an optional label.
Primary dividers are those used to separate the modules, whereas secondary
dividers may be used inside modules to logically separate different sections.
When a section or module is empty then the styles used for the divider are those
with the `off` qualifier.

### Common styles

These are general purpose [ANSI][ansi] styles defined for convenience and used
within the default modules.

 * `style_selected_1`
 * `style_selected_2`
 * `style_low`
 * `style_high`
 * `style_error`

Custom modules
--------------

The idea of custom modules is that they provide ways to access readonly
information from the target program status; it is safe to assume that they will
be queried during the program execution only.

Custom modules must inherit the `Dashboard.Module` class and define some
methods:

 * `label` returns the module label which will appear in the divider.

 * `lines` return a list of strings which will form the module content. When a
    module is temporarily unable to produce its content, it should return an
    empty list; its divider will then use the styles with the `off` qualifier.

The name of a module is automatically obtained by the class name.

Modules are instantiated once at initialization time and kept during the whole
the GDB session.

Optionally, a module may include a description which will appear in the GDB help
system by specifying a Python docstring for the class.

Optionally, a module may define stylable attributes by defining the `attributes`
method returning a dictionary in which the key is the attribute name and the
value is another dictionary:

 1. `default` is the initial value for this attribute.

 2. `doc` is the documentation of this attribute which will appear in the GDB
    help system. This key can be omitted.

 3. `name` is the name of the attribute of the Python object, defaults to the
    key value.

 4. `type` is the type of this attribute, it is used to coerce the value passed
    as an argument to the proper type, or raise an exception. This key defaults
    to the `str` type.

 5. `check` is a control callback which accept the coerced value and returns
    `True` if the value satisfies the constraint and `False` otherwise. This key
    is optional, when omitted no check is performed.

Optionally, a module may declare subcommands by defining the `commands` method
returning a dictionary in which the key is the command name and the value is
another dictionary:

 1. `action` is the callback to be executed which accepts the raw input string
    from the GDB prompt. Callbacks may raise exceptions to notify erroneous
    situations which message will be shown automatically to the user.

 2. `doc` is the command documentation.

 3. `completion` is the completion policy, one of the `gdb.COMPLETE_*` constants
    defined in the [reference manual][completion]. This key is optional and
    defaults to `None` which is equivalent to `gdb.COMPLETE_NONE`.

### Common functions

A number of auxiliary common functions are defined in the global scope, they can
be found in the provided [`.gdbinit`][raw] and concern topics like [ANSI][ansi]
output, divider formatting, conversion callbacks, etc. They should be more or
less self-documented, some usage examples can be found within the bundled
default modules.

### Example

Default modules already provide a good example, but here is a simple module
which may be used as a template for new custom modules, it allows the programmer
to note down some snippets of text during the debugging session.


```python
class Notes(Dashboard.Module):
    """Simple user-defined notes."""

    def __init__(self):
        self.notes = []

    def label(self):
        return 'Notes'

    def lines(self, term_width, style_changed):
        out = []
        for note in self.notes:
            out.append(note)
            if self.divider:
                out.append(divider())
        return out[:-1] if self.divider else out

    def add(self, arg):
        if arg:
            self.notes.append(arg)
        else:
            raise Exception('Cannot add an empty note')

    def clear(self, arg):
        self.notes = []

    def commands(self):
        return {
            'add': {
                'action': self.add,
                'doc': 'Add a note.'
            },
            'clear': {
                'action': self.clear,
                'doc': 'Remove all the notes.'
            }
        }

    def attributes(self):
        return {
            'divider': {
                'doc': 'Divider visibility flag.',
                'default': True,
                'type': bool
            }
        }
```

To use the above just save it in a Python file, say `notes.py`, inside
`~/.gdbinit.d/`, the following commands (together with the help) will be
available:

    dashboard notes
    dashboard notes add
    dashboard notes clear
    dashboard notes -style

Minimal requirements
--------------------

GDB dashboard requires at least GDB 7.7 compiled with Python 2.7 in order to
work properly.

See [#1](https://github.com/cyrus-and/gdb-dashboard/issues/1) for more
details/workarounds.

On Windows the `windows-curses` Python package is needed in order to obtain the
correct terminal size.

Additional GDB front ends
-------------------------

GDB dashboard is not meant to work seamlessly with additional front ends, e.g.,
TUI, Nemiver, QtCreator, etc.

There are basically two options to work around this:

 * if the main debugging tool is GDB dashboard then it is recommended to prevent
   the front end from loading the `.gdbinit` file, they usually have an option
   to do so;

 * otherwise it is possible to load GDB dashboard manually, that is, install as
   usual then:

        mv ~/.gdbinit ~/.gdb-dashboard

   finally load it when needed from the GDB shell:

        source ~/.gdb-dashboard
